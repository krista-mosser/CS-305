Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial consultant company that wanted to develop an application to reach more of their customers and wanted to make sure that their customers' data was secure.  

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I believe I performed the dependency checks particularly well, mostly because I had step-by-step direction.  Coding securely is important to avoid or reduce the risk of security compromises which can cause data loss, financial loss, and loss of trust by customers. Making sure that software is secure keeps the application productive and allows customers or end users to trust that their communications via the application is secure.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
I found using the vulnerability assessment flowchart very challenging.  It was very vague and required much external research to try to determine what exactly each category included.  I also struggled with manual review of the code itself.  My knowledge of coding is still at a very basic level, and therefore understanding what exactly the provided code did required a lot of research for me.    

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I first determined the client's needs and what areas of vulnerabilities I would need to be on the lookout for.  I then ran through a manual check of their code for any potential vulnerabilities using a vulnerability assessment.  I then also ran a dependency check on the code itself.  

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I implemented in their code a hash function to be used to encrypt their data and the access to it.  I also updated the Springboot version to address many of the vulnerabilities the dependency check found.  Lastly, I created a self-signed certificate and tried to implement it in the code, although I was not successful at this.  Once I did all of this, I then manually rechecked the code and re-ran the dependency check and then reran to the code to confirm there were no errors.  

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The Maven dependency check and the certificate creation will definitely be helpful in future assignments.  

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I would probably use the Security Report to show them that although I had very little knowledge at the beginning of this course, I was able to complete assisgned tasks through research and persistence, showing that I do not like to give up on jobs assigned to me.
